#For any call to ebay_fee(), how many assignment statements will execute?
#What does ebay_fee() return if its argument is 0.0?
#What does ebay_fee() return if its argument is 100.0?

###Challenge 1###

# Write a function call using the ebay_fee() function to determine the fee for a selling price of 15.23,
# storing the result in a variable named my_fee.

###Challenge 2###

#Define function print_popcorn_time() with parameter bag_ounces. If bag_ounces is less than 3, print "Too small".
#If greater than 10, print "Too large". Otherwise, compute and print 6 * bag_ounces followed by "seconds". End with a newline.

# ''' Your solution goes here '''

# user_ounces = int(input())
# print_popcorn_time(user_ounces)

###Challenge 3####

# Write a function shampoo_instructions() with parameter num_cycles. If num_cycles is less than 1, print "Too few.".
# If more than 4, print "Too many.". Else, print "N : Lather and rinse." num_cycles times, where N is the cycle number, followed by "Done.".

# Sample output with input: 2
# 1 : Lather and rinse.
# 2 : Lather and rinse.
# Done.
 
# Hint: Define and use a loop variable.

# ''' Your solution goes here '''

# user_cycles = int(input())
# shampoo_instructions(user_cycles)
